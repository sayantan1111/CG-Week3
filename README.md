# Week 3: Data Structures & Algorithm Fundamentals

Welcome to Week 3 of our Java learning journey! This week dives into essential data structures and algorithmic principles in Java. We’ll cover encapsulation and interfaces, and then move into foundational data structures like LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, and more. We’ll also learn common searching and sorting algorithms and analyze their runtime using Big-O notation.

## Overview

This week we focused on strengthening our understanding of Java’s core data structures and how algorithms behave in terms of time and space complexity. You will implement basic algorithms manually and explore Java’s built-in tools to handle collections and data operations efficiently.

### Day 1: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interfaces
- Access modifiers and encapsulation
- Introduction to polymorphism
- Interface vs abstract class
- Method overriding and dynamic dispatch

### Day 2: LinkedList
- Singly and doubly linked lists (concept and implementation)
- Java’s `LinkedList` class
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal
- Comparison with arrays

### Day 3: Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps & Hash Sets
- Stack and Queue operations using arrays and LinkedLists
- Using Java Collections (`Stack`, `Queue`, `Deque`)
- Hashing concept, collisions
- `HashMap` vs `HashSet` with use cases

### Day 4: Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort
- Introduction to Merge and Quick Sort
- Sorting stability and complexity
- Practical sorting examples in Java

### Day 5: Linear and Binary Search
- Linear search basics
- Binary search (iterative and recursive)
- Preconditions for binary search
- Efficiency comparison

### Day 6: Algorithm’s Runtime Analysis & Big-O
- Time and space complexity
- Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega
